            <p>The world is shifting toward greater environmental awareness, and sustainable fashion has become more popular than ever. Driftline has responded with cutting-edge eco-friendly surf apparel designed for both performance and sustainability. Our focus goes beyond appearance, as we aim to reduce our environmental impact while delivering top-quality gear for surfers who value responsibility and high standards.</p>

        <section class="performance">
            <h2>Performance Without Compromise</h2>
            <p>We understand that surfers demand flexibility, durability, and comfort. Driftline’s eco-friendly boardshorts are crafted to deliver exceptional performance while reducing environmental harm. Instead of using unsustainable materials, our products are made with recycled polyester derived from post-consumer plastic bottles.</p>
            <p>Each pair transforms discarded plastics into high-quality fabric, helping to keep waste out of our oceans and landfills. This process not only reduces pollution but also ensures our boardshorts meet the rigorous demands of surfing. With features like exceptional stretch and quick-drying fabric, Driftline’s eco-friendly boardshorts deliver all the performance you need without compromising sustainability.</p>
